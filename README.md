# Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹ :computer:

I'm a software developer at Vanguard in Malvern, PA where I work on projects to help clients succeed financially. I graduated from Gettysburg College in 2020 with a degree in computer science. 

While there, I had the opportunity to perform [research](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/papers/eaai19-boaf-solve.pdf) in the field of artificial intelligence. We published our work and presented it at EAAI 2019. I was also the President of Gettysburg's chapter of ACM.
