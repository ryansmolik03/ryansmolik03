# Hi, I'm Ryan 👋 :computer:

I'm a software developer in the Bay Area 🌁. I graduated from [Gettysburg College](http://gettysburg.edu) in 2020 with a degree in computer science. 

While there, I had the opportunity to perform [research](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/papers/eaai19-boaf-solve.pdf) in the field of artificial intelligence. We published our work and presented it at EAAI 2019. I was also the President of Gettysburg's chapter of ACM.

Since 2020, I have been working on backend development mostly in Java but more recently in Python and Kotlin.
